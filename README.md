# Unhandled API Response and Data Structure Errors in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications involving API calls and data handling.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API, but lacks robust error handling for several scenarios:

1. **API Request Failure:** The code handles the general case of an HTTP error but doesn't provide more specific error messages or user feedback.
2. **Unexpected JSON Structure:** The code assumes the API response will always have an `'items'` key containing a list.  It does not handle cases where this structure is different or the key is missing.
3. **Missing Data Keys:** The code assumes each item in the list has a `'name'` key.  It crashes if an item lacks this key.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more robust and error-resistant version of the code.
